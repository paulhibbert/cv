An online which uses no Javascript, just static hand-crafted semantic HTML and CSS.

The CSS has not changed from its original 2021 incarnation and so uses a media query for responsiveness. The break point is at 800px. Smaller than the content has no grid layout. At 800px a simple grid layout is applied to the three section elements.

Icons are inline [feather icons](https://feathericons.com/).

A previous version had a mouse running around on the screen using CSS animations with transform translateX and Y to move the SVG of the mouse around in a rectangle, its there in the git history but I removed it as it was rather distracting I thought.
